Goals for this week:

- [x] Create a file to store datasets
- [x] Find datasets that are relevant to answering our research questions 
- [x] Go through datasets to assess which ones are the most useful 
- [ ] Save datasets in a file so that they are easily accessible and try to save them in the same format (e.g., all excel sheets, all R codes)
- [x] Potentially start working on cleaning any datasets that have a lot of missing values, typos, remove and or add whitespace characters, etc.

Progress for this week: 

- We successfully created a way for us to share datasets with one another through a one drive folder
- We loaded all of the datasets from the project proposal into R Studio to view them in a table format, with the exception of the "weekly" dataset which seems to be giving some problems 
- We began cleaning the datasets that had a lot of repeating information and information that was not relevant to our particular research questions

Goals for this week:

- [ ] Continue to clean the data and check the accuracy of the information
- [ ] While we were cleaning some of the datasets we realized that some say Tom Brady's first name is "Tom" and others say "Thomas" so this disorganization will make it more challenging to perform analyses. We want to standardize the data by doing such things as assigning one id number to each player that is the same throughout each dataset 
- [ ] Our data is mostly from 1999-2023 so perhaps we shrink our datasets by specifying what year range is exactly what we want 
- [ ] Once the data is clean, save the datasets in the file that we created
- [ ] If time permits, start playing around with visualizations (preferably through PowerBI and Tableau)
